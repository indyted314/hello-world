My first repository on GitHub.

About me:
Recently I was at a party meeting new people and when they asked me what was new or what I did, I found myself tongue tied. This did not exactly exude confidence.  It make me feel like a kid being asked what they were going to study in college when they don't even know IF they are going to college after high school.  This just tells me that I'm going through some changes now and am not really sure who I am right now.  And stangely I'm fine with that.  I'm developing the picture of what I want my future to look like.
